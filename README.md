Commonly, keyword is the most important component to represent the content of an article. Besides, keyword also has an important role to help us find an article through search engine, bibliographic database, etc. Keyword that we usually found in an article is result of the article extraction. This experiment aim to extract keywords from abstract of an article with Natural Language Processing. The extracted keywords then will visualized using Python Chart.
